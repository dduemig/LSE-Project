#The global financial crisis of the twenty-first century remarkably spanning from 2007 to 2009, impacted everything within the global #money and capital markets, also when the money market funds in the United States famously “broke the buck.” The crisis, characterized by extensive failures of large-scale banks and unprecedented mortgage delinquencies, led to a dip in the US stock market capitalization by more than 50 percent, and, as reported by the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), general volatility leaped almost ten-fold, from being as low of 9.4 in December 2006 to the value of 89.5 in October 2008. Noteworthy, are the consequences of the crisis as felt by equity investors, in other words: the effect of the deep recession on equity returns and their correlations. This paper assesses how the 2007-2009 global financial crisis impacted the structure of the Standard and Poor's 500 (S&P 500) firms by assessing the market risks of some of them before and during the crisis.
